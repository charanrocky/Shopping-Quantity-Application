### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
